## About
This repository contains files for the Projects developed by Misha Nelyubov during the Fall 2021 instance of CSE321: Real-Time Operating Systems at UB.

## Project 1
This project focused on standards for documentation.  The project contains the following files:

- CSE321_project1_mnelyubo_template.cpp will be used as the basis for all C++ files written for CSE321 by Misha Nelyubov
- CSE321_project1_mnelyubo_corrected_code.cpp is a program written in C++ to oscillate the blinking of a light on a Nucleo L4R5ZI
- push-ToGitRepo.ps1 is a PowerShell script to push files from the working Mbed Studio directory into the Git version control directory

## Project 2
This project tracks the design and development of a countdown timer which can be programmed by its user through a peripheral keypad and displays output text with an LCD display.  The project contains the following files:

- CSE321_project2_mnelyubo_main.cpp is the C++ file which implements the core functionality of the countdown timer
- CSE321_project2_stage2_part1_mnelyubo.pdf provides a high-level overview of the design of the microcontroller behavior
- 1802.cpp and 1802.h are the library files for interacting with the output LCD

## Project 3
This project tracks the design and development of a used-volume monitor for a container to notify when there is still food present at the end of a work day.  The objective of the project is to minimize food waste by alerting staff of leftover food that can be taken home before leaving work.
