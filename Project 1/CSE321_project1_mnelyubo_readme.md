This file has lots of things. There is a os typle tool used to create periodic events with a periepherial. The name of the file and the contents in here will be entirely updated.

- cycleLedState:
    - This function runs continously once called.  Whenever the global variable oscillateLED_L is low, this function will begin a cycle in which it turns on an LED for 2000 ms and then turns it off for 500 ms before repeating this behavior.
