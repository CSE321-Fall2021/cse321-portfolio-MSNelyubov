# About
Project Description:
This project tracks the design and development of a used-volume monitor for a container to notify when there is still food present at the end of a work day.  The objective of the project is to minimize food waste by alerting staff of leftover food that can be taken home before leaving work.  Modular elements from Project 2 are reused in this project to control previously implemented peripherals.

The project contains the following files:

# Features
The code in this repository will execute on a Nucleo L4R5ZI to control an embedded system in order to
- Measure and report the used space of a container as a function of the the distance between the base and top of the container
- Report if there is food left over inside of the container at the end of a work day
- Provide a user interface to input the current time and closing time after which to alert staff
