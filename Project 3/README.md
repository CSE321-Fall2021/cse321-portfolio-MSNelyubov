# About
Project Description:
This project tracks the design and development of a used-volume monitor for a container to notify when there is still food present at the end of a work day.  The objective of the project is to minimize food waste by alerting staff of leftover food that can be taken home before leaving work.  Modular elements from Project 2 are reused in this project to control previously implemented peripherals.
